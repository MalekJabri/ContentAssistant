Subject: Property Damage Claim – Policy No. 567890

Hi,

I need to report some damage to my property caused by a storm on 2 March 2025 in Milan, Italy. During the storm, a large tree from my neighbour's garden was uprooted and fell directly onto my garage roof, causing extensive damage to the roof tiles and the structure itself. In addition, my car, which was parked inside, has a damaged windshield and some dents on the bonnet.

I contacted a local contractor for an assessment, and the repair costs are estimated to be around €4,500 for the garage and an additional €1,200 for the car repairs. I have attached photos of the damage, the contractor’s estimate, and a copy of the weather report confirming the storm.

Could you please advise me on the next steps for this claim? Also, I would like to know if my policy covers temporary storage for my car while the garage is being repaired.

Grazie mille,
Tommaso Rossi
