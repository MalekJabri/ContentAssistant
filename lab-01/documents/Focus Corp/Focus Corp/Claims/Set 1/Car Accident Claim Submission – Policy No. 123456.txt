Subject: Car Accident Claim Submission – Policy No. 123456

Dear Focus Corp Claims Team,

I hope you’re doing well. I am writing to report a car accident I was involved in on 28 February 2025 in Berlin, Germany. The accident occurred at around 15:30 at the intersection of Alexanderplatz and Karl-Liebknecht-Straße when my vehicle was stationary at a red light. I was rear-ended by another car, which failed to stop in time. As a result, my car’s rear bumper and boot sustained significant damage, and my taillights were also broken.

Following the incident, I immediately contacted the local police, who arrived at the scene and filed an official report. I have attached a copy of this police report for your reference, along with several photos showing the extent of the damage. I also went to an authorised repair centre to get an estimate, which has been included in the attachments. The estimated cost for repairs is approximately €2,300.

Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could confirm whether I am eligible for a courtesy car while my vehicle is being repaired. If there are any additional documents or information you need, please let me know.

I look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance in processing my claim as quickly as possible.

Kind regards,
John Schmidt
