Subject: Water Damage Claim – Policy No. 789012

Hi there,

I am writing to submit a claim for water damage that occurred in my flat on 1 March 2025 in Lyon, France. The incident was caused by a burst pipe in the kitchen that flooded the area within minutes. By the time I managed to turn off the main water valve, the water had already caused extensive damage to the flooring, lower cabinets, and several appliances, including my dishwasher and oven.

Here are the details of the claim:

Name: Sarah Dupont
Policy Number: 789012
Address: 14 Rue des Fleurs, 69001 Lyon, France
Description:
After discovering the leak, I immediately contacted an emergency plumber who managed to stop the flooding. The plumber's report, which I have attached, indicates that the pipe burst due to wear and tear. I also contacted a local repair company for an estimate, which is included as well.
Estimated Cost: Approximately €7,800, covering both the plumbing repairs and the replacement of damaged items.
Attachments:

Could you please confirm the next steps for processing this claim and whether you require an assessor to visit the property? I would greatly appreciate your guidance.

Merci beaucoup,
Sarah Dupont
