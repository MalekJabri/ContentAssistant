Subject: Health Insurance Claim for Surgery

Hello,

I am writing to submit a claim for a medical procedure I underwent on 20 February 2025 at St. Mary’s Hospital in Dublin, Ireland. I suffered a knee injury during a football match and was advised by my orthopaedic specialist to undergo surgery to repair a torn ligament. The procedure was successful, and I am currently undergoing physiotherapy as part of my recovery plan.

The total cost of the surgery and initial physiotherapy sessions came to €11,500. I have attached the following documents to this email:

The hospital bill, detailing the cost of surgery, anaesthesia, and hospital stay.
A report from my doctor outlining the necessity of the procedure and expected recovery time.
Invoices for the physiotherapy sessions I have attended so far.
I would be grateful if you could let me know the timeline for processing this claim and if there are any additional forms I need to complete. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to your response.

Thank you very much,
Michael O’Connor
